About Me
======
I'm currently a second-year M.S. student under the supervision of [Prof. Yanwei Fu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Vg54TcsAAAAJ&hl=en). 
My research interests focus on human-centric AI-generated content (AIGC), including human image animation, facial appearance editing, etc.
